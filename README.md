# CO Air Quality Heatmap Project üåçüî•

This project visualizes the weekly average air quality data (specifically **Carbon Monoxide - CO**) from monitoring sites on an interactive heatmap using Python and `folium`. The heatmap provides a dynamic way to track CO pollution over time across various locations.

## üöÄ Features

- **Dynamic Heatmap with Time:**
  - Visualizes weekly average CO Air Quality Index (AQI) values across multiple monitoring sites.
  - Provides a time-lapse animation to observe trends and changes in CO pollution over weeks.

- **Interactive Visualization:**
  - Users can zoom in/out and interact with the map to explore CO pollution in specific locations.

- **Customizable Color Gradient:**
  - Blue: Low CO levels.
  - Green: Moderate CO levels.
  - Yellow: High CO levels.
  - Red: Very high CO levels.

- **Weekly Aggregation:**
  - Computes the average CO AQI values for each monitoring site on a weekly basis.
